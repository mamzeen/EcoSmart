# Waste-to-Energy Project - Shell Hackathon

Welcome to the Waste-to-Energy project developed as part of the Shell Hackathon. Our primary goal is to revolutionize the supply chain for biofuel production by leveraging residual biomass in the Gujarat state of India. Through innovative solutions, we aim to optimize the processes involved in biomass collection, preprocessing, and transportation to biorefineries, all while adhering to practical constraints and minimizing costs.

## Problem Overview

In this project, we're faced with the challenge of forecasting the spatial distribution of biomass availability across the Gujarat region. Our task extends to identifying strategically optimal locations for preprocessing depots and biorefineries. All of this must be accomplished while ensuring that real-world constraints are met. The biomass distribution is represented in a grid format, necessitating the design of an efficient supply chain that seamlessly transports biomass from its point of origin to biorefineries.

## Task

Your mission is to develop a cutting-edge solution that effectively tackles two major aspects of our challenge:

1. **Optimal Placement of Depots and Biorefineries:**
   You are tasked with creating an algorithm or approach that will intelligently identify the best locations for preprocessing depots and biorefineries. These key facilities will play a vital role in streamlining the entire biofuel production process. By optimizing their placement, you will contribute to reducing transportation costs, enhancing resource utilization, and minimizing underutilization costs.

2. **Accurate Biomass Availability Forecasting:**
   Your solution must also incorporate a mechanism for accurately predicting the availability of biomass across the Gujarat region. This forecasting aspect is pivotal in ensuring the smooth operation of the supply chain. By making precise biomass availability predictions, you will assist in minimizing forecast mismatches and associated costs.
